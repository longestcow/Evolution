# Evolution
Evolution Simulation
Use space to check current survivors (cells in a safe box) and go to next generation of cells.  
Pressing r clears the current generation, allowing you to start a new fresh generation of cells using space.  
Use 1-9 and the 4 arrow keys to switch the safe box areas.  


Inspired by [the dude who simulated evolution with neural networks and then never looked back at youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3tRFayqVtk).
My version is similar except without the use of actual neural networks and more of just parents passing off traits that they used to survive.  
A cool thing I found was that if you spam space really hard, not allowing most of the cells to reach the safe boxes in time, the fast ones survive, eventually making every cell extremely fast. 
Also mutations can occur every 500 cells so every 5 generations, and if none of the cells make it to the safe box, that generation keeps retrying again until eventually a [specific mutation occurs](https://youtu.be/crEHOCfDqJ4?si=dOB6AgyX1ket3CEw&t=127) that allows that cell to reach the safe box and repopulate the area all by itself.
I don't really expect anyone to download a jar file and run it and all of that so instead I'll just link a [clip](https://youtu.be/crEHOCfDqJ4) of me playing around with it.
